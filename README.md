# mionlang
A very lightweight language for Touhou-styled STG development.

Probably, **MYON** stands for **M**ion is my **Y**et-another named-after-U-N-**O**we**n** STG development language. God knows...
(Yes, mion is an alternative spelling. Probably stands for an ion of an element labelled as M?)
